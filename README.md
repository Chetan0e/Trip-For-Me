Trip For Me is an autonomous AI-powered travel agent that generates complete, personalized trip plans from a single prompt. Users simply specify their destination, dates, budget, and travel preferences, and the system produces optimized flight options, hotel suggestions, activity plans, budgets, and a detailed day-by-day itinerary — all in seconds.

The app is built using React, Google Maps API, and the Google GenAI SDK, leveraging Gemini 3 Pro / Gemini 2.5 Flash for intelligent reasoning. A structured JSON schema forces the model to output multiple components simultaneously — flights, hotels, transit options, activities, and costs — ensuring consistency across the entire trip plan. Gemini analyzes timing, route feasibility, transportation constraints, and pricing logic to ensure every result is realistic and actionable.

Trip For Me matters because travel planning is tedious and fragmented across dozens of websites. By compressing hours of research into a single AI-driven workflow, we democratize access to high-quality, personalized itineraries. The app gives users clarity, confidence, and a complete trip blueprint they can instantly book through integrated links.

Built inside Google AI Studio, the system uses Gemini for multimodal reasoning, itinerary generation, budget forecasting, and optimization based on user preferences. This project demonstrates the potential of agentic AI to automate complex decision-making and deliver real-world value at scale.
